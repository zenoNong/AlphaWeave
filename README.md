AI-Powered Multi-Factor Alpha Generation & Backtesting Engine

### 🔍 Problem:
Most retail strategies rely on basic technical indicators. Institutions use complex multi-factor models combining fundamental, technical, and alternative data to find alpha. Replicating this at your scale is both rare and impressive.

### 🔧 What to Build:
- Create a Python-based trading engine that allows users to define and test multi-factor models (e.g., momentum, mean-reversion, volatility).
- Integrate fundamental data (e.g., P/E, ROE), technical indicators, and NLP sentiment (e.g., news headlines, earnings reports).
- Use machine learning (Random Forests, XGBoost, or LSTM) to dynamically re-weight factor importance over time.
- Perform backtesting with walk-forward validation and risk-adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown).

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, yFinance, Alpha Vantage, HuggingFace Transformers (for NLP)

### 🌟 Impact:
Shows deep integration of data engineering + ML + quant modeling

Competitive with entry-level hedge fund tools like QuantConnect or Backtrader
